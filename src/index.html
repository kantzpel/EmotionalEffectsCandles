    <p>In Harvard's article, "The value of light," they explain a lack of sunlight causes or can contribute to seasonal affective disorder, or SAD.
      "Bright light works by stimulating cells in the retina that connect to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that helps control circadian rhythms. Activating the hypothalamus at a certain time every day can restore a normal circadian rhythm and thus banish seasonal symptoms."
      Essentially, light has great value when it comes to mood-altering. Light comes in many forms: sunlight, LED, candles, and more. By utilizing lighting options like candles during the winter, you can decrease your seasonal affective disorder symptoms.
